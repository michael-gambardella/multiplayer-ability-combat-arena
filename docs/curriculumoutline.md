# Multi-Ability Arena Curriculum Outline

## Program Summary
- Program: Multi-Ability Arena Engineering and Professional Delivery
- Duration: 12 weeks
- Modality: Lecture + Guided Lab + Weekly Quiz + Milestone Tests
- Platform Focus: UEFN + Verse
- Outcome: Build, validate, and professionally present the full project described in `docs/GAME_OVERVIEW.md`.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Design and implement state-driven multiplayer match flow in Verse.
2. Build modular combat systems with scalable data structures.
3. Implement and balance four hero kits with role identity and counterplay.
4. Author custom Verse devices for projectile simulation, area effects, knockback, and status tracking.
5. Deliver complete production artifacts: tests, technical writeup, release assets, and portfolio narrative.

## Course Phases

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Week 1: Architecture, project setup, and state machine design
- Week 2: Player lifecycle, team balancing, and hero select flow
- Week 3: Health, damage pipeline, elimination, respawn, and assists
- Assessment: Phase 1 Test (end of Week 3)

### Phase 2 - Ability Platform (Weeks 4-6)
- Week 4: Ability framework, cooldown tracking, and event routing
- Week 5: Titan and Specter implementation
- Week 6: Sage and Blaster implementation, status effect rules
- Assessment: Midterm Practical (end of Week 6)

### Phase 3 - Match Experience (Weeks 7-9)
- Week 7: Scoring, timer, sudden death, and kill feed
- Week 8: HUD systems, combat readability, and feedback loops
- Week 9: Arena hazards, spawn weighting, and fairness validation
- Assessment: Phase 3 Integration Test (end of Week 9)

### Phase 4 - Polish and Delivery (Weeks 10-12)
- Week 10: VFX/SFX polish and game feel pass
- Week 11: Balance methodology, playtest analysis, regression strategy
- Week 12: Publishing workflow and professional project defense
- Assessment: Final Exam + Capstone Demo (end of Week 12)

## Weekly Structure
- Lecture A: Systems and architecture concepts
- Lecture B: Applied implementation and engineering tradeoffs
- Lab: Deliverable implemented in repository
- Quiz: 8-12 questions, concept and implementation checks
- Test Artifact: Update sprint test report or milestone validation document

## Grading Model
- Weekly quizzes: 20%
- Labs: 35%
- Milestone tests (Phase 1, Midterm, Phase 3): 25%
- Final exam + capstone defense: 20%

## Required Deliverables
- `docs/tests/SPRINT_1_TEST_REPORT.md` through `docs/tests/SPRINT_10_TEST_REPORT.md`
- `docs/TECHNICAL_BREAKDOWN.md`
- `README.md` with architecture summary and gameplay evidence
- 1-3 minute gameplay demonstration reel plan and script

## Professional Communication Targets
1. 90-second architecture summary
2. 5-minute deep technical walkthrough
3. Q and A readiness on data structures, vector math, multiplayer logic, and tradeoffs
